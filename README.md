This project is about an E-commerce PetStore. The project was created with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, and SQLite. You can log in, register, simulate a purchase of products.
If you are logged in as an admin, you have an extra session where you can add products, assign roles to other users, add new categories, new pets, and have a look at all the products in the store
